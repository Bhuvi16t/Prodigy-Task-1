# Prodigy-Task-1
Task-01  Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.
ask-01: Visualizing Distribution of a Variable

Purpose:
The purpose of this task is to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. This can help in understanding the composition of a population based on various characteristics such as age, gender, or any other relevant variable.

Data:
Ensure that you have a dataset containing the variable you want to visualize. The dataset can be in any format such as CSV, Excel, or a database.

Tools Required:
Python
Libraries: Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn (optional)
Steps:
Import Required Libraries:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns (optional for styling)
Load Data:

Use pd.read_csv() or any other appropriate function to load your dataset.
Prepare Data:

If necessary, clean and preprocess your data to extract the variable you want to visualize.
Create Visualization:

For categorical variables: Use a bar chart (plt.bar() or sns.countplot())
For continuous variables: Use a histogram (plt.hist() or sns.histplot())
Customize Visualization (Optional):

Add title, labels to the axes.
Customize colors, styles, etc.
Display Visualization:

Use plt.show() to display the visualization.
